# BRCTC_Vibe_DotNet

I did absolutely no research before creating this program. A work associate informed me that Windows IOT existed and could support .NET programs for the Raspberry Pi. I literally came home and rewrote my python code in a day. That being said, I was unfamiliar with both .NET Core and UWP when I created this. I believe the poor performance is simply due to my ignorance. I may return to this program at a later date and rewrite it. 

The prospect of it was super interesting. With it being a background service, it would simply just need to be published and then would work in the background. My other programs required me to make a systemd service where the program would initiate after the PI booted and the user was fully logged on. This program theoretically could have saved us time when moving to a fresh install.
